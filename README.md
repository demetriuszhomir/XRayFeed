## Update

### Manual Update Process

To update the extension, replace the `latest` folder of the extension with the `latest` folder of the build you've downloaded & extracted from the ZIP file. The path must stay the same as before.
<br>
❗ **Then refresh the extension on the Extensions page.**

Also, you can extract the ZIP over the existing files from any previous version, but make sure to keep the path the same.

### Update Notifications

The extension automatically checks for updates from GitHub releases.

You can see its **current version** in the popup UI.
<br>
When a new version is available, it also shows "**Update available**" with a direct **link to the latest release**. Also, the **icon badge** will appear if it's enabled in settings.

If you're on a **stable release**, you'll only be notified about newer stable releases. If you're on a **prerelease** — then any newer release (stable or prerelease).
<br>
⚠️ *NOTE: if a prerelease gets updated to a stable release, it'll be scanning for newer stable releases only.*
